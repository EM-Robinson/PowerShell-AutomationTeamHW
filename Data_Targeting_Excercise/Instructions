# Data Targetting Instructions:

1.)	Data Targeting
a.	Create a method that accepts a string parameter.  The parameter is an employee full name.  The method should return a string that is the employee first name and last name only in the following format “First Name: $value Last Name: $value”.  Using your method, read the included CSV file name field, looping through all records, and applying your method to the name field.
i.	This question focuses on data targeting.  You discard data that does not meet the target requirement. i.e. a middle name is thrown away
